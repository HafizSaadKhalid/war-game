# Represent Your City

A text-based geopolitical multiplayer game MVP built with Next.js App Router and Tailwind CSS.

## Run locally

Requirements: Node.js 20.9 or newer.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Create a representative profile, then use the dashboard. The profile is saved in browser `localStorage`; it is not shared across browsers or devices. The city-work and neighbor-attack actions are interface placeholders.

## Push to GitHub and deploy on Vercel

1. Create an empty repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/new). In this project folder, run:

   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Build Represent Your City MVP"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. Sign in to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new) with GitHub, choose **Add New Project**, and import the repository.
3. Keep the detected Next.js framework and default build settings, then select **Deploy**.

Vercel builds the project automatically and provides a live URL. Later pushes to `main` trigger new deployments. No environment variables or database are needed for this MVP.
